# Programming problem
 
A command line program is needed to show the user 6 options to carry out various tasks as
detailed below. The program should allow the user to be able to select any of the options
repeatedly as long as they don’t choose option 6 – which allows the user to exit the
program. Each option is to be written as a python function, taking the necessary inputs if
any from the user from the command line and the included files.

Option 1: Read file “input_data.txt” from the folder “data” into the program. Then remove
duplicate and blank lines from this data. Then store this data as “input_formatted_data.txt”
in folder “output”. If the folder is not present, create the folder.

Option 2: Read files “input_data2.txt” and “input_names.txt” from folder “data” and create
a single file merging this data – “output_merged_data.txt”. Each line in the created file is to
be unique based on the name (first column of each input file). So if the name is present in
the both input files, the rest of the data has to be merged.

Option 3: Generate a sine wave of amplitude 2 at 50 Hz over 4 seconds. Then plot this on a
graph with time on x axis and amplitude on y axis. Save this graph with title above the plot
saying “sine wave – 50 Hz”, x axis label as “Time (s)” and x axis ticks every 0.5 second, y axis
label as “Amplitude (V)” and y axis ticks every 0.4 v ranging from – 1.5 to 1.5V. Save this plot
in the folder named “output” with the filename “&lt;your first name&gt;_sine_wave.png”.

Option 4: Read files “input_temperature1.txt” and “input_temperature2.txt” to get the time
and temperature recorded by two sensors in a room. Plot these as two lines with different
colours in a graph [red, blue]. Also plot the average of the two sensors over time as another
plot line in a different colour [green]. Add the legend, plot title as “temperature comparison
plot”, x &amp; y axis ticks and labels and save this in the folder named “output” with the
filename “&lt;your first name&gt;_temperature_plot.png”.

Option 5: Read files “actualtemp.csv”, “set_temperature.csv” and “input_voltage.csv”.
Combine these to a single file with one column as constant and the rest of the data from the
files as additional columns and save this file to folder “output” under the name
“combined_data.csv”. Then plot the data from “actualtemp.csv” and “set_temperature.csv”
in a graph and save it as “temp_compare.png” in folder “output”. Add the legend, plot title
as “temperature comparison plot”, x &amp; y axis ticks and labels. Also plot the voltage as
another graph and save it in the same folder as “voltage_plot.png”. Add the legend, plot
title as “voltage plot”, x &amp; y axis ticks and labels.
